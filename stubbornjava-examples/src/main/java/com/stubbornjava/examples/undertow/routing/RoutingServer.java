    /*
     * Utilize Undertow's RoutingHandler for HTTP Verb / path routing.
     * We can utilize the fallback handler for the not found handler.
     *
     * Using the RoutingHandler we can generally achieve a single line per route.
     * It also decouples the HttpHander from the route which encourages reuse.
     * A good example would be a single error handler or not found handler that can
     * be passed to multiple routes or nodes in the routing tree as it gets more complex.
     * For instance you can have an ExceptionHandler that handles 404's by delegating to the
     * notFoundHandler and you can also use the same notFoundHandler as the RoutingHandlers
     * fallbackHandler.
     *
     * How you organize your routes is entirely up to you and Undertow is very flexible
     * in this regard. StubbornJava tends to use a single file for routing even if it gets
     * to 100+ routes. It is very convenient for searching code and trying to track down the
     * code that is executed for a given route. Also using the method reference style there
     * should be almost no logic in the file so readability isn't a major concern.
     *
     * If you do prefer splitting your routes out for reuse take a look at RoutingHandlers
     * addAll method. This allows you to pass a RoutingHandler into a RoutingHandler to add
     * all of its routes. Using this approach when you construct the server you can create a
     * new RoutingHandler and pass in each individual RoutingHandler. This can also be great
     * for common routes across services like health checks or system diagnostic routes.
     *
     * You might want to split the Routes into their own file separate from the server
     * initialization code.
